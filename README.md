# pico-placa-predictor
Predictor for the trafic restriction policy "Pico y Placa" previously implemented in the city of Quito. The program allows users to type in their license plate, a date, and a time, and tells them if they are allowed to take their car outside or not.

To run the program in the terminal use the command: **python predictor.py** and follow the menu instructions.
To run the unit tests use the following command: **python -m unittest test_predictor.py**
